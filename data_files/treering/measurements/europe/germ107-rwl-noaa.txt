A 500-Year Dendroclimatic Reconstruction of Spring/Summer 
Precipitation from the Lower Bavarian Forest Region, Germany. 
International Journal of Climatology, 25: 611-630.

#   Abstract: This paper presents a 500 year March-August precipitation reconstruction for the Bavarian Forest region of southeast
# Germany based on a composite, well-replicated data set of 676 living and historical tree-ring width series from Norway
# spruce. Two versions of the chronology are developed. The cubic smoothing spline (SPL) chronology, standardized
# with a fixed 80 year spline function, retains decadal and higher frequency variation. The regional curve standardization
# (RCS) chronology uses regional curve standardization to retain additional lower frequency variation from the same
# data. Calibration (1879-1978) of these chronologies with March-August precipitation indicates they explain 40% (SPL)
# and 34% (RCS) of the variability in the instrumental precipitation record. The SPL reconstruction models the high frequency
# variation better, whereas the RCS reconstruction tracks the low-frequency trends more robustly. It suggests
# that spring-summer precipitation was above the long-term average for the periods 1730-1810 and 1870-2000, about
# average between 1560 and 1610 and that significantly drier periods occurred during 1510-60, 1610-35, 1660-1730 and
# 1830-70. The low-frequency trends of the RCS reconstruction during the 19th century were verified by comparison with a
# regional precipitation series derived from 14 long precipitation records from central Europe. Better verification results were
# obtained using the original (non-homogenized) records over this interval. These results suggest that some low-frequency
# variability may have been removed during correction of these early records. Periods of synchronous decadal variability
# were observed between the SPL series and independent dendroclimatic reconstructions from central Europe. The RCS
# reconstruction is the first dendroclimatic precipitation reconstruction in Europe to capture low-frequency information.
# These long-term trends, however, are difficult to verify owing to the paucity of other proxy precipitation records in
# central Europe that portray low-frequency information. Further verification and testing of the RCS reconstruction will
# require the development of additional reconstructions from tree-rings (or other proxy data series) that similarly target
# low-frequency variability.
